**I built this website to give users a fun and enjoyable game to play featuring cats. Many people are obsessed with cat photos on the internet and I felt that the subject matter would appeal to many users both young and old.**
## UX ##
**The purpose of this project is to create am interactive frontend website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In order to do this I have built a memory card game. The user can choose from 3 difficulty levels and try to beat their score based on number of guesses as well as by the amount of time taken to complete the game**






**I incorporated the following things in order for the target audience to have a great experience when visiting my website,**

- A Home page which explains how to play the game and asks the user to choose a difficulty level before starting.
- A contact page so users can submit feedback about the game to help with any future updates to the game.
- Social media links for users to follow to stay up to date with any news the band may have
- I have matched the design of the webpage to match the content and used colours and fonts appropriate to the content

   - The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole site, with sans-serif as fallback in case the font does not load correctly. It is frequently used and easy to read. 
   - The Anton font is used for headings throughout the site, with sans-serif fallback in case the font does not load correctly, it is optimised for a bold display on modern web browsers.
